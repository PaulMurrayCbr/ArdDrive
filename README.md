# ArdDrive
An android app that drives an Arduino over bluetooth. Works with my el-cheapo Samsung tablet and a sparkfun bluetooth module plugged into an UNO.

## TODO
* fix layout of main activity - the fragment is drawing itself on top of the menu.
* consider protocol for byte stream. JSON? ASN?
* write a sample app that actually does some blinkenlights
